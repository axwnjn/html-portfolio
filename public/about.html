<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
  Took a little longer than most to finish college — five years, to be exact.
  But hey, not all good things come quick.
</p>

<p>
  While others were busy jumping into big companies or launching cool projects,
  I was quietly figuring out where I fit. Turns out, I enjoy breaking things (in
  a good way), spotting what doesn’t work, and making sure stuff runs like it’s
  supposed to. That led me to QA. Right now, I’m diving deeper into software
  testing — manual and automation. Learning tools like Selenium, writing test
  cases, and getting better at thinking like a user who just wants things to
  work.
</p>

<p>
  I’m looking for my first opportunity — an internship or full-time role — where
  I can learn hands-on, bring value to the team, and grow into someone who helps
  make great products even better.
